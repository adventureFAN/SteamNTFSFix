# SteamNTFSFix

**Fix Steam + Proton compatibility issues when your Steam library is on an NTFS drive.**

SteamNTFSFix is a small GUI tool that moves Proton prefixes from an NTFS partition  
to a Linux-native location (e.g. ext4), and creates a symlink back. This avoids  
`OSError: Invalid argument` caused by Steam/Proton trying to use symlinks on NTFS.
